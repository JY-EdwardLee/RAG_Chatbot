A charged lithium- ion battery can catch ﬁre\nand/or explode if accidentally punctured.\nIf your battery is swollen, take appropriate precautions. Do not heat your phone. If needed, you can use a dropper\nor syringe to inject isopropyl alcohol (90+0/0) around the edges of the back cover to weaken the adhesive. Swollen\nbatteries can be very dangerous, so wear eye protection and exercise due caution, or take it to a professional if\nyou’re not sure how to proceed.\nThis guide involves removing the rear glass. Removing the rear glass destroys the adhesive holding it in place.\nFollow this guide to reinstall the rear glass.\nTOOLS\nSuction Handle (1)\nTweezers (1)\nSpudger (1)\niOpener (1)\nPhillips #00 Screwdriver (1) SIM Card Eject Tool (1)\niFixit Opening Picks (Set of 6) (1)\nPARTS\nGalaxy S6 Battery (1)\nGalaxy S6 Battery Adhesive Strips (1)",
    "Page 4": "Step-by-Step Instructions\nstep 1 — SIM Card\nInsert a paper clip or SIM eject tool into the hole in the SIM card slot on the power button side of the phone.\nPress to eject the SIM card tray.\nDon’t press too hard or you may damage the SIM card tray.\nstep 2 \nRemove the SIM card tray from the phone.\nStep 3 — iOpener Heating",
    "Page 5": "We recommend that you clean your microwave before proceeding, as any nasty gunk on the bottom may end\nup stuck to the iOpener.\nPlace the iOpener in the center of the microwave.\nFor carousel microwaves: Make sure the plate spins freely. If your iOpener gets stuck, it may overheat and\nburn.\nStep 4\nHeat the iOpener for a little seconds.\nDepending on the wattage of your microwave, more or less time may be required. The iOpener is suﬃciently\nheated when it’s barely too hot to touch.\nThroughout the repair procedure, as the iOpener cools, reheat it in the microwave for an additional thirty\nseconds at a time.\nBe careful not to overheat the iOpener during the repair. Overheating may cause the iOpener to burst. Do not\nattempt to heat over 100˚C (212˚F).\nNever touch the iOpener if it appears swollen.\nIf the iOpener is still too hot in the middle to touch, continue using it while waiting for it to cool down some more\nbefore reheating. A properly heated iOpener should stay warm for up to 10 minutes.",
    "Page 6": "steps\nRemove the iOpener from the microwave, holding it by one of the two ﬂat ends to avoid the hot center.\nThe iOpener will be very hot, so be careful when handling it. Use an oven mitt if necessary.\nStep 6 — Alternate iOpener heating method\nIf you don’t have a microwave, follow this step to heat your iOpener in boiling water. Fill a pot or pan with\nenough water to fully submerge an iOpener.\nHeat the water to a boil. Turn oﬀ the heat.\nPlace an iOpener into the hot water for 2-3 minutes. Make sure the iOpener is fully submerged in the water.\nUse tongs to extract the heated iOpener from the hot water.\nThoroughly dry the iOpener with a towel.\nThe iOpener will be very hot, so be careful to hold it only by the end tabs.\nYour iOpener is ready for use! If you need to reheat the iOpener, heat the water to a boil, turn oﬀ the heat, and\nplace the iOpener in the water for 2-3 minutes.\nStep 7 — Rear Glass",
    "Page 7": "Opening your phone will compromise its waterproof seals. Have replacement adhesive ready before you\nproceed, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your phone without replacing the adhesive.\nIf your glass is shattered, put packing tape over the entire panel to hold it together during the removal process.\nLay the heated iOpener over the rear panel for about two minutes to loosen the adhesive around the edge of\nthe glass.\nYou may need to reheat and reapply the iOpener several times to get the phone warm enough. Follow the\niOpener instructions to avoid overheating.\nShift the iOpener to heat the remaining section of the panel for another two minutes.\nA hair dryer, heat gun, or hot plate may also be used, but be careful not to overheat the phone—the OLED\ndisplay and internal battery are both susceptible to heat damage.\nStep 8\nOnce the rear glass is hot to the touch, apply a suction cup near the bottom edge of the glass.\nLift on the suction cup to create a small gap underneath the rear glass, and insert an opening pick into the gap.\nOptionally, once the pick is inserted, you can add a few drops of isopropyl alcohol into the gap to help weaken\nthe adhesive in the following steps.\nStep 9",
    "Page 8": "Slide the pick along the bottom edge of the phone to slice through the adhesive securing the rear glass.\nAfterward, it may help to leave the pick in place and grab a second pick as you proceed to the next step.\nLeaving the pick inserted can help prevent the glue you just separated from re-adhering.\nRe-heat the rear glass as needed to prevent the glue from cooling and hardening.\nStep 10\nRepeat the heating and cutting procedure for the remaining three sides of the phone.\nLeave an opening pick under each edge to prevent the adhesive from resealing.\nStep 11",
    "Page 9": "Use an opening pick to slice through any remaining adhesive.\nRemove the rear glass.\nStep 12\nTo install new rear glass:\nUse tweezers to peel away any remaining adhesive from the phone’s chassis.\nClean the adhesion areas with high concentration isopropyl alcohol (at least 90%) and a lint-free cloth. Swipe in\none direction only, not back and forth. This will help prep the surface for the new adhesive.\nPeel the adhesive backing oﬀ of the new rear glass, carefully line up one edge of the glass against the phone\nchassis, and ﬁrmly press the glass onto the phone.\nIf you’re reinstalling the old rear glass, or using rear glass without adhesive pre-installed, follow this guide.\nStep 13 — Midframe Assembly\nRemove the thirteen 3.5mm Phillips #00 screws securing the midframe to the phone.",
    "Page 10": "Step 14\nBefore you perform this step, make sure you’ve ejected the SIM card tray.\nFirmly grasp the edge of the midframe assembly.\nLift up on the midframe assembly while pushing down on the battery to separate the midframe assembly from\nthe rest of the phone.\nWhile lifting the midframe, be careful to avoid snagging it on the audio jack or charging port.\nOnce the midframe is partially seperated, carefully run an opening pick around the edges of the rest of the\nphone to separate the top of the midframe.\nBe careful not to accidentally insert the opening pick between the glass and display.\nTo avoid damage to the headphone jack, remove the top of the midframe ﬁrst, then push the midframe\ndownwards to disengage it from the headphone jack.\nYou may need to heat and apply an iOpener to the edges of the display to soften the display adhesive if\nmidframe separation is diﬃcult.\nStep 15\nLift the midframe assembly up to separate it from the rest of the phone.\nStep 16 — Disassembling Samsung Galaxy S6 Battery Connector",
    "Page 11": "Use the ﬂat end of the spudger to disconnect the battery connector from its socket on the motherboard.\nStep 17 — Battery\nInsert a plastic opening pick between the case and the battery.\nBe careful to keep the pick as ﬂat as possible to avoid bending the battery, which may damage it and cause it to\nrelease dangerous chemicals.\nPush the pick further in to separate the battery from the phone.\nIf the battery is too strongly adhered for the opening pick, place a warm iOpener over the battery to loosen the\nadhesive.\nAlternatively, apply some isopropyl alcohol under each corner of the battery and allow it to penetrate for several\nminutes to help weaken the adhesive.\nDo not pry against the motherboard or you may damage the phone.\nStep 18",
    "Page 12": "Remove the battery from the phone.\nDo not reuse the battery after it has been removed, as doing so is a potential safety hazard. Replace it with a\nnew battery.\nFollow these instructions to install a new battery and adhesive.\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order. When reinstalling the rear glass, refer to\nthe rear glass adhesive replacement guide.\nAfter completing this guide, calibrate your newly-installed battery.\nTake your e-waste to an R2 or e-Stewards certiﬁed recycler.\nDocuments / Resources\nIFIXIT Samsung Galaxy S6 Battery [pdf] Installation Guide\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Battery, Samsung Galaxy, S6 Battery, Battery\nReferences\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/galaxy-s6-battery-adhesive-strips\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/galaxy-s6-replacement-battery\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/iﬁxit-opening-picks-set-of-6\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/iopener\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/phillips-00-screwdriver\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/spudger\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/suction-handle\n store.iﬁxit.fr/products/tweezers\n How to Apply Custom-cut Battery Adhesive - iFixit Repair Guide\n iOpener Heating - iFixit Repair Guide\n Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Rear Glass Adhesive Replacement - iFixit Repair Guide\n Samsung Galaxy S6 Rear Glass Adhesive Replacement - iFixit Repair Guide",
